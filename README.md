# React/Redux practice
I wanted to practice using react/redux to play with single page web app, making it responsive and withthe ability to easily add on components as I find new things to practice. 

App uses express server, knex for migrating databases, as needed. Playing with SVG, practicing CRUD and RESTful routes also. 

Feedback, tips and tricks very welcome. 

To grab this repo and make it your own:
* Fork this repo
* Rename the app to your project/repo name

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[your-org]/[your-app].git
cd [your-app]
yarn
```

If you have an existing repo that you'd like to redirect this to, you can do this via the terminal:

```sh
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/[your-org]/[your-app].git
```

Get started and view in your browser:
```sh
yarn start
OR
yarn dev
```
View via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
