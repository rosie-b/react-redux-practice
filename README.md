# React/Redux practice

To set up:
* Fork this repo
* Rename the app to your project name

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[your-org]/[your-app].git
cd [your-app]
yarn
```

If you have an existing repo that you'd like to redirect this to, you can do this via the terminal:

```sh
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/[your-org]/[your-app].git
```

Get started and view in your browser:
```sh
yarn start
```
View via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
